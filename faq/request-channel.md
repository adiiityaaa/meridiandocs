# Request Channel

## Why are my Messages Getting Deleted?

This is the basic concept of Request Channel. Any messages sent in the request channel will be deleted so that the embeds are visible to members. It is recommended to only send song name/URL in the request channel and nothing else.

## Embeds don't get edited Instantly.

Developers are aware of this issue. It is due to the API of Discord as well as handling in the Database. We are constantly trying to introduce new methods to reduce the lag.

## What are the buttons?

These buttons are used to control the Player. Please refer to Request Channel to get an idea of exact use of each button.

## No Results found for the query.

It usually happens if the Player cannot find any valid songs regarding the input. Please try again if you get this error. If the problem persists, please contact [Developers](https://discord.gg/xe7GTYh9PR).
